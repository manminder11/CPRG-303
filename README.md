# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

Install all listed software below
	VSCODE – used as a code editor  
	NODEJS – used to create react native project 
	EXPO GO (in mobile) - used for emulation of the application
In this scenario the configuration is only required for NODEJS to do that in the command line type the following command 
node -v 
OR 
node --version

PROJECT CREATION -->> -->>

------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT ON A MOBILE PHONE?

	NEXT STEP IS – to open this file with VSCODE  
In the VSCODE open this in terminal 
In terminal 
If user want to open the prebuild application 

in android or iPhone 
npx expo start 
   This command will provide a barcode to scan by using the mobile camera and after scanning mobile will work as an emulator 

Additional information – the user needs to sign in in the Expo go in mobile phones to run the application correctly
